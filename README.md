# Decoding Facial and Image Recognition using Convolutional Neural Network

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for image recognition using TensorFlow, OpenCV and Keras. The CNN architecture is designed to classify images of cats and dogs, leveraging the power of deep learning to accurately differentiate between the two classes. The project utilizes a comprehensive dataset containing various breeds of cats and dogs, obtained from Kaggle.

## Basic Definition and Background

A CNN is a type of deep neural network specifically designed for analyzing visual images. It consists of multiple hidden layers, including convolutional layers, activation layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. CNNs excel at feature extraction and classification tasks, making them ideal for image recognition.

## Data Description

The dataset used for training and testing consists of images of various cat and dog breeds, sourced from Kaggle. The dataset is divided into training and testing sets, with careful consideration to ensure data integrity and model generalization.

## Proposed Methodology

The proposed method utilizes a multilayer perceptron with a specific architecture tailored for recognizing two-dimensional image data. The CNN architecture comprises an input layer, convolutional layer, pooling layer, and output layer. The CNN algorithm extracts features from images through convolution and pooling operations, followed by classification using fully connected layers.

## System Architecture

The system architecture consists of the following components:
- Input Image
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Output Label (Image Class)

The CNN is trained using a dataset divided into training and testing sets, with the training process optimizing the model's accuracy. The trained model is then evaluated using the test dataset to assess its performance.

## Description of Algorithm

The CNN model utilizes convolutional layers to extract features from input images, followed by fully connected layers for classification. The Adam optimizer is employed for adaptive learning rate optimization, enhancing the model's training efficiency and accuracy.
